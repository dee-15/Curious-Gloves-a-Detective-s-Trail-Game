# Curious-Gloves-a-Detective's-Trail-Game

A tile-based 2D game where a thief makes use of Minimax algorithm to reduce distance to the final destination and Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path. Built using the Unity app, C++ and C#, this project very well demonstrates AI pathfinding, game strategy and the principles followed for designing the game in an engaging and animated experience.

## Features

- Tile-based grid system for player movement
- AI-based movement where Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm is used for reducing distance between the start and end point and Minimax Algorithm for finding the shortest path.
- Smooth character animations 
- Refined visuals with animated backgrounds and obstacles
- Full game logic tested and debugged
- Seamless integration of C++ logic with Unity via C#

## Tech Stack

- Unity (Game Engine)
- C++ (Core Game Logic for AI)
- C# (Bridge between Unity and C++)
- Git & GitHub (Version Control)
